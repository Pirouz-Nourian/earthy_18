###Forming
<br />The architectural planning was based on the logic of the cellular automaton. In a finite grid of cells, neighborhood cells or closest points are defined in relation to a specified cell. An initial state is defined, in this case a starting point with an empty field. In the process of translating this logic into spatial architecture, the specified cell is seen as a person in the field. This person is taking a path with a specific direction. After each iteration the path is further defined and with it a new generation of cells is defined in relation to the persons position. This process requires parallel sketching and imagining of the actual path. Finally the plan was manually executed in which this logic was incorporated.

<br />This plan generated from the logic cellular automata was then used as a basis for forming. The form included two parts: the compression only dome structures and the tent roof on anchor walls. These structures were generated using dynamic relaxation by particle spring method with aid of grasshopper plugin -Kangaroo. The inputs for form generation of domes were center lines of the plan. On the other hand, the anchor walls were planned architecturally and could be modified on basis of structural input, the footprint of tent roofs were used for dynamic relaxation. These forms were structurally examined and finally adorned with earthbag layering, bottle arrangement and brick patterns based on the construction logic. These elements came together to form the Earth institute.

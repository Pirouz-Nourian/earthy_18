INSTRUCTIONS

The script is a tool for making a REL chart of triangular shape that is equivalent to a symmetrical REL 2D matrix.
It is used for the creation of a graphically better representation of the matrix, with symbols replacing the connection factors (ranging from 0-1).
Instead of using Illustrator and sacrifising a lot of time, one can use this tool by just providing an Excel sheet as an input and modifying the input parameters.

No Rhino file needed. Lunchbox plugin used for its Excel Reader component.

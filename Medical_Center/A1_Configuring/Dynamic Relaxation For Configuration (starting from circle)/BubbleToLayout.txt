INSTRUCTIONS

The algorithm attempts to bridge the gap between a bubble diagram and an actual floor plan layout.
Circles corresponding to spaces start from a polar arrangement and are relaxed (using Kangaroo) based on connections recorded in a REL chart.
Stronger connections are represented by stronger attraction forces, whereas connections that are not desirable are represented by repulsion forces.
The circle radii are proportional to the space areas.

No Rhino file needed.
Excel file and Kangaroo plugin needed. Lunchbox plugin is also used for its Excel reader component.

INSTRUCTIONS

This algorithm is based on the concept of lookup tables.
Different roof typologies are created and inserted in a list.
A roof configuration is recorded in a 2D matrix (Excel) using the indices of the roof typologies in the roof list:
each roof type is represented by its index.
Then, a python script places the roof units on a grid according to the given 2D matrix.

Rhino file not needed. Lunchbox plugin used for its Excel Reader component.

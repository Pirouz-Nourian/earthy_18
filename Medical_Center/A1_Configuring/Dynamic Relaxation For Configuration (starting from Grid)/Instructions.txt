- The Excel sheet is used for establshing the floor areas of each programme in the building, and the degree of importance of connectivity between each of them.

- The GH file reads the excel file and generates a possible simplified layout for the building corresponding to the floor areas and connections stated in teh Excel sheet. 

No Rhino file is needed.

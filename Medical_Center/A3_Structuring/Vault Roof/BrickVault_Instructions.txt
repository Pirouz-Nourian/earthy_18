Desctiption:
This script has 2 python codes;
1 - a script to place bricks on a vault shape in a stretcher bond.
2 - a script that makes visual lines and outputs parameters for the construction method. THe method uses two strings represented by lines that form a triangle shape. One being the hypotenuse, one being the vertical. THe script outputs 2 numbers for the length of each line by brick layer. Using that one can place points and then interpolate a curve to guide where bricks can be placed to form the vault.

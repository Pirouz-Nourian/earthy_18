INSTRUCTIONS

The script serves as a tool to create the particular brick pattern (English bond with the chosen corner solutions) on any given wall based on certain properties.
These properties are based on our team's analysis of the ward modules. For example, we have two values for wall thicknesses: 0.40 and 0.20m.
Other parameters include the shape, size and existence of openings on the walls.

Because of time constraints, this script solves the bottom part of the short module walls (not the catenary at the top).
The long walls will be created in a similar manner.
The openings creation part is not included in this version of the script.

Rhino file not needed. Elefront plugin used for its Bake Objects component.

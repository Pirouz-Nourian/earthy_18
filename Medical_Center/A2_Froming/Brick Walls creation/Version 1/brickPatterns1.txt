INSTRUCTIONS

This script attempts to create a brick wall based on the chosen pattern (English bond).
This wall is created in such a way that, when rotated by 90 degrees and shifted vertically by a row, it fits with the existing wall (protrusion on the left side, intrusion on the right side).
The openings (defined by a list of closed curves) are created by subtraction, thus they are not always constructible.

As for the coding itself, the script creates contour curves on the given surfaces, using a distance equal to the brick length.
Each contour curve is split in half, and divided in units of length equal to one quarter of the brick length, starting from the midpoint.
In this way, symmetry is achieved.
The index of each (half curve) indicated its position in the pattern. Even indices correspond to left half curves, whereas odd ones correspond to right half curves.
Furthermore, the curves with index that, when divided by 4, produces a remainder of 0 or 1, are called "even" and correspond to the "long bricks" part of the pattern.
The rest of the curves (with index that, when divided by 4, produces a remainder of 2 or 3) are called "odd" and correspond to the "short bricks (headers)" part of the pattern.
These indices are evaluated with the help of a counter that follows the nested loop.

The folder contains one Grasshopper (GH) file, one python file (.py) and one Pdf file.

The script places bricks in a dome-surface. Suggestions for future work include the alternating pattern for the bricks.
In order to place bricks in a vault, the isocurves can be used, as it is a single-curvature surface. However, for the dome, which 
has double curvature, another method is used (GH script):
1. Evaluate the dome surface at a” lower” point and the center point.
2. Create a line with these two points.
3. Project the line in the dome surface.
4. Divide the line with division distance being the height of the brick (horCrvs).


The GH python definition has instructions included. For the GH python script, the parameters are the following:

   Inputs:
* srf: The reparametrized surface of the dome (surface).
* horCrvs: Horizontal curves on the surface, with the same distance between them (list of curves).
* brick: The Brep of the brick to be used (Brep).
* brk_ht: The height of the brick (float).
* brk_len: The length of the brick (float).
* y_spacing: The space between the bricks in y-axis(float).
* x_spacing: The space between the bricks in x-axis(float).
    Output:
* a: Bricks (list).

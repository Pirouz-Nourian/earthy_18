The folder contains one Rhino file, two Grasshopper (GH) files, two python files (.py) and two Pdf files.

The medical center consists of 3 different types of wards, in order to accommodate different needs: 1.private rooms, 
2. semi-private rooms (consisting of 2 or 3 rooms), 3. shared rooms (consisting of 4 or 6 rooms).Because of the large number 
of wards, a script was developed, in order to create and place automatically the wards. Due to limitation of time, two scripts 
were developed for two types of wards: private and semi–private rooms(2 rooms: left and right). The script for the semi-private 
rooms is based on the script for the private rooms. For that case, a counter is used, in order to separate the left from the 
right room. Suggestions for future work include the development of scripts for the rest of the types of wards, following the 
same logic as the semi-private rooms.

- The Rhino file contains the floor plan of the medical center. Each closed curved of the plan represents a function. 
- The GH file, named “private_ward” creates and places the ward module for the private rooms (3x6m).
- The GH file, named “semi-private_ward” creates and places the ward module for the semi - private rooms (2 rooms). 
  That typology consists of two rooms (left and right room), 3x6m each.
- The Pdf files show the flow-chart for those scripts and the floor plan of the medical center.

Each room consists of five walls and the floor. The roof of the rooms will be added later, as that is the outcome of the dynamic relaxation.
More specifically, the walls in the long axes (left and right wall) are load bearing, and therefore have a thickness of 40cm. 
The front wall is 20cm thick. The back wall is 20cm thick if it is an interior wall, and 40cm if it is an exterior wall. 
The interior wall is 40cm thick for thermal reasons (thermal inertia and insulation). Also, the curves for the openings: 
opening_01, opening_2, opening_03 is the outcome of the structural analysis. 

   Inputs:
* opening_01: The curve for the opening for the right and left wall (curve)
* opening_02: The curve for the opening for the front and interior wall (curve)
* opening_03: The curve for the opening (window) for the interior wall (curve)
* wards_crvs: The curves (plan view) for the semi - private rooms (list of curves)
* courtyards_crvs: The curves (plan view) for the courtyards (list of curves)
* labs_crv: The curves (plan view) of the laboratory department (curve)
* nursery_crv: The curves (plan view) of the nursery department (curve)
* boundary_crv: The outline of the floor plan (curve)
* backOpeningsNumber: The number of the openings on the back wall (int)
* backOpeningsSize: The size of the openings on the back wall (float)
    Output:
* modularConfig: The modules (Brep)

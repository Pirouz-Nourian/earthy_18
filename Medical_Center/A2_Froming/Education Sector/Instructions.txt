This folder contains 1 Rhino file and 1 grasshopper script.

- The Rhino file contains the courtyard model and some curves and points used as inputs for the GH file.

- The GH file creates the education sector by means of parametric design to establish a starting mesh, and then putting this mesh through a dynamic mesh relaxation process to attain a desirable architectural form for the education sector. 

This file serves mostly as an example of how dynamic mesh relaxation can be controlled to achieve certain forms with structural feasibility.
